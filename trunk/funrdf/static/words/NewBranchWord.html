<h1>NewBranchWord</h1>
Create a new Branch command word. A branch consumes the top item on the stack and does one of two things depending on its "truth" value. Unlike Loops and Sequences which use all the items on the stack, Branch commands only take the top two items. The item on the top of the stack should be a function to use in case of "true" and the second should be a function to use for "false".</body>
