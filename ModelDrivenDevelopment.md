# Model Driven Development #

I saw [Jon Jacky's talk at Northwest Python Day 2010](http://www.seapig.org/NWPD10) and I've wanted to use [the PyModel tools](http://staff.washington.edu/jon/pymodel/www/) for web app design and development ever since.

In the [mdd directory](http://code.google.com/p/funrdf/source/browse/#svn/trunk/mdd) I've adapted some of the sample model code from the PyModel package to begin to describe a simple email signup process.
