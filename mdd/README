Some notes on using PyModel.
============================

After adding the pymodel-0.85/src directory to my PYTHONPATH environment
variable so the PyModel code can find its imports, and symlinking the
pma.py, pmg.py, and pmt.py scripts into my local bin dir (I drop the
'.py' suffixes from the symlinks) I can call the PyModel tools like so:

    funrdf/mdd$ pma EmailSignupModel
    30 states, 100 transitions, 6 accepting states

Which generates an EmailSignupModelFSM.py script.

But first you have to put the models dir on the PYTHONPATH as well (this
is covered in the docs for PyModel, and there's a script called tpath in
the pymodel-0.85/src directory which will do this for the current
directory.)

    funrdf/mdd$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.

Then you can run the pmg script to generate a dot file:

    funrdf/mdd$ pmg EmailSignupModelFSM

Creates 'EmailSignupModelFSM.dot' which can be fed to the Graphviz tools
to generate various visua;izations. (Again, there are scripts that come
with the PyModel package that simplify this.)

    funrdf/mdd$ dot -v -Tsvg -o EmailSignupModelFSM.svg EmailSignupModelFSM.dot

Creates 'EmailSignupModelFSM.svg' which you can view in a browser, etc...

There is a lot more information on this tool chain in the PyModel docs.
